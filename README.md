Using the Giphy API this web page displays gifs calling the Giphy API. It uses Javascript and JQuery to change the HTML of this site.

User clicks a button and the page should display 10 gif images from Giphy API and display them.  If one of the still images is clicked, the gif should become animated. Cicking again stops the animation.  

Each gif should display a rating provided by the Giphy API
